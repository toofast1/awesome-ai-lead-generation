# Contributing to Awesome AI Lead Generation

We love contributions! Please read these guidelines before submitting a PR.

## Rules for Submission

1. **AI-Focused:** The tool must have a clear AI component or be essential to the modern AI growth stack.
2. **Active Project:** We do not list dead projects. The tool must be maintained.
3. **No Affiliate Links:** Please submit direct links only.
4. **Alphabetical Order:** Please verify the ordering within the specific category.

## How to add your tool

1. **Star this repository.** (It helps the community grow!) ⭐️
2. Go to the `README.md` file.
3. Click the "Edit" pencil icon.
4. Add your link in the correct category using the format:
   `- [Tool Name](URL) - Description of what it does.`
5. Submit a Pull Request with the title: `Add [Tool Name]`.

## Descriptions

Keep descriptions short and objective. Avoid marketing fluff like "The World's Best." Focus on the *utility* (e.g., "Automates LinkedIn outreach" vs "Revolutionizes your life").
